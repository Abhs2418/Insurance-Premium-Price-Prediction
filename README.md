Insurance Premium Prediction aims to  machine learning techniques to estimate health insurance premiums based on various individual factors.Data Preprocessing:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Initial analysis is conducted using libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions and relationships.
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers to ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for regression

## Model Building:
<br>
Various regression algorithms are employed to predict premiums, including:
Linear Regression<br></br>
Decision Tree Regressor<br></br>
Random Forest Regressor<br></br>
Gradient Boosting Regressor<br></br>
</br>

Applying various evaluation metrics like RMSE,MSE,etc.
By empowering users with knowledge about their insurance costs, this project aims to facilitate better decision-making regarding health coverage options.
